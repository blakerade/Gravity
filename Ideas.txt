-Find gravity is a one time function. Velocity/Distance to get which one we will commit to.

-Put legs down when bMagnitize is active.

-Hud flashes first time gravity is availible.

-Machine combat: basic assualt rifle and a grenade launcher possibly.

-Cylinder floors?

-Smooth of walking in sphere by looking at how walking on sphere works.

-Animations are complete first draft trash.

-Leaving last gravity turns off Magnitize (should probably be switched to leave it on).

-Increase boost speed.

-Change Yaw in air to being turn by torque and not AddActorRotation.

-GameMode where there is a ball that getes pushed to other base (hole in sphere).

-Figure out texture streaming warning nonsense.

-Figure out locking rotation when on a floor so we can use stairs/ramps.

-Air Move in basepawn can probably be moved to the main move function with a Axis3D input
